I created a smiley face that makes the "bruh" sound effect. 
The way that I did this was first creating my scripts consisting of the scores 
and health that would change when clicking the spheres. The scores increase by
increments when clicked while the health would decrease by 10s. When creating the
audio scripts I created what would happen when the player click's the spheres
and when it would play audio "+=" for enable and "-=" for disable.
